### Part 1: Fundamentals of Prompt Flow

What is the purpose of prompt flow in LLM applications?

A) To design how inputs are structured and processed (Correct Answer)

Which feature of Azure supports prompt flow testing?

A) Integrated Debugging (Correct Answer)

A use case for an LLM with prompt flow can be a customer support chatbot. The input will be user queries, like how do I reset my password. The prompt can provide context to the context, telling it it's customer support assistant and asking to respond to the following questions. The output can be a relevant response addressing the user's question. For instance, asking a question to reset the password will result in the bot sending a reset password link.

### Part 2: Building LLM Applications

Designing a content generation tool in Azure presented several challenges. The major challenge was ensuring the prompt is effective because if it was too vague, then the model would generate generic content. Another challenge was handling diverse user input. For instance, users can enter broad prompts like AI or extremely specific prompts. To overcome these challenges, I iteratively tested prompt variations, trying to balance creativity and user-guided input. Azure's drag and drop interface made assembling the workflow really easy and allowed for adjustments with coding.

### Part 3: Monitoring and Maintaining LLM Applications

Monitoring ensures application performance and helps identify potential issues. (True)

Version control is not necessary for maintaining LLM applications. (False)

Monitoring key metrics like latency and error rates is essential for optimizing LLM applications and ensuring a seamless user experience. Latency measures the time taken for a response, and high latency can lead to user frustration, especially in real-time applications like chatbots or customer support assistants. Error rates indicate issues such as failed responses or API timeouts, which can degrade reliability. For example, if a chatbot takes too long to respond, users may quit their interactions. By recording these metrics, developers can scale their resources or optimize prompt efficiency. Similarly, error rates can help developers find areas of failure and implement fallback mechanisms.
